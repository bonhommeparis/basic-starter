# Configuration

There is three files here, one for the path, one for the tasks options
and one for nunjucks. Feel free to add or change anything dependings
on what you need.

## Paths

The attributes `projectname` is the name of the page, it should be the same
as the folder name in [public](https://bitbucket.org/bonhommeparis/bnhmm-tagheuer-landing-starter/public).

## Tasks
This configuration file is linked with the [defaults tasks](https://bitbucket.org/bonhommeparis/bnhmm-tagheuer-landing-starter/gulpfile.js/lib/task-defaults.js).
It will override default task configuration.

## Nunjucks
